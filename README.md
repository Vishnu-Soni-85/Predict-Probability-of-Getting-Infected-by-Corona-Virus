# Predict-Probability-of-Getting-Infected-by-Corona-Virus
Problem Statement -
This machine learning problem is designed to cater the need of a prediction model
that can predict the probability of a person getting infected by covid-19.
The whole world is participating in a fight against this pandemic. The
healthcare data science community can have a big impact on combating this
disease. There have been many excellent efforts to use data
visualization and monte carlo simulations to help combat the spread of this
pandemic. The expected prediction model would address a complimentary
and important aspect of health policy, identifying those most at risk. By
combining the efforts of these and many other excellent efforts in the
healthcare technology space, we hope to mitigate the effects of this terrible
disease.
